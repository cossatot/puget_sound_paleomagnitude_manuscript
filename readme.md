This repository hosts the code and data for a paper in review that
estimates the magnitudes of paleoearthquakes in the Puget Sound region, by
Richard Styron and Brian Sherrod.

The code requires the [`culpable`](https://github.com/cossatot/culpable) 
library and its dependencies, which should be satisfied with a current Anaconda 
python distribution. The only code to be run to replicate our analyses is a 
script called `p_M_DL.py` in the `scripts` directory; it can be run like a 
standard Python script.
